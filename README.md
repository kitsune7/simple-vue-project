# simple-vue-project

The code for this was scaffolded based on the instructions on Vue's official [Quick Start](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) page in their documentation. It's been modified to demonstrate compatibility with a [code change](https://github.com/formio/vue/pull/77) in `@formio/vue`.

## Want to see this with something other than Vite?

New Vue projects use Vite by default, but you can also see this working on the `webpack` branch if you're curious about how compatible it is with other bundlers.
